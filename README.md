# ⚡ Competitive Programming Journey

This repository documents my progression in competitive programming. It serves as the codebase for my practice sessions and contest up-solves.

I focus mainly on **Codeforces**, aiming to gain experience and problem-solving skills.

### 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] Level A (In Progress)

### 🛠 The Stack
